/**
 * Signing in with Google.
 *
 * THE OWNER'S DECISION, recorded here so it is not re-litigated: signing in
 * with Google lands on THE SAME ACCOUNT as the password. It is not a second
 * account and not a second identity — it is the same person, allowed to skip
 * typing a password. An email that already has an account signs into that
 * account, with everything already in it.
 *
 * THE ONE THING THAT MAKES THAT SAFE is `email_verified`. Linking by email
 * means whoever proves they hold an address gets the account behind it, so the
 * proof has to be real. Google says whether it has actually verified the
 * address, and it is not always true — a Workspace account on a custom domain
 * can carry an address nobody confirmed. Accepting one of those would hand a
 * stranger somebody else's saved trips, their boarding passes and their notes,
 * and it would look exactly like an ordinary sign-in. So an unverified address
 * is refused outright rather than treated as a weaker yes.
 *
 * Pure functions, no network and no store, so every refusal above can be
 * tested without either.
