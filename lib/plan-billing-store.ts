/**
 * Where the plan-offering switch lives, and where a live subscription is
 * written down.
 *
 * TWO THINGS, KEPT APART ON PURPOSE.
 *
 * The offering is one record: is this open, how does somebody pay, what are the
 * prices. It is the owner's setting and nothing else writes it.
 *
 * A subscription is one record per account, written by the Stripe webhook and
 * read by the account page. It is deliberately NOT the account's plan — the
 * plan is on the account record, which is the one place anything asks "what is
 * this person allowed to do". This holds the *why*: which Stripe customer, when
 * it renews, whether it is about to end. So a plan set by hand by the owner and
 * a plan set by a card work identically everywhere else on the site, and losing
 * this store demotes nobody.

 * their own Advisor Starter before they ever joined an agency is still
 * being charged for it, and somebody who bought One Trip still owns that
 * one trip forever. Dropping either to free would keep taking the first
 * one's money while showing them nothing for it, and would quietly undo a
 * purchase that has no expiry at all for the second. A live subscription
 * wins when there is one; a One Trip purchase (which never lapses) is
 * checked next; free is what is left once neither is true.
