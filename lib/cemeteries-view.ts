 * the stored one was dropped on the floor.
 *
 * A stored burial now replaces the built-in one of the same name, and keeps
 * its position in the list rather than jumping to the end. Anything not
 * matching a built-in name is appended, which is what this used to do and is
 * still right for somebody genuinely new.
 *
 * Field by field rather than wholesale: an override that leaves the yahrzeit
 * blank should not erase a yahrzeit the built-in record already has. Clearing
 * a field that only the built-in supplies is not possible this way, which is
 * the same trade the contacts merge below makes.
