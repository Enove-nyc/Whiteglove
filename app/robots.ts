/**
 * What a crawler may and may not read.
 *
 * THERE WAS NO robots.txt. The address returned the "Destination not found"
 * page, because it fell through to the [city] route and was treated as a town.
 *
 * The disallow list is the SAME list the sitemap refuses to include, from
 * lib/site-map.ts. Two hand-written lists is how a page ends up submitted in
 * one and forbidden in the other, which Google reports as an error against the
 * whole site.
 *
 * NOT A SECURITY MEASURE, and it must not be mistaken for one. robots.txt is a
 * request that well-behaved crawlers honour; it is also a public list of where
 * the interesting things are. Everything under /admin and /account is behind a
 * real check of its own, and would be with or without this file.
 */
/**
 * Both lines a private address needs.
 *
 * A TRAILING SLASH ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH, and this is easy to get wrong: robots.txt
 * matches on prefix, so `Disallow: /admin/` covers /admin/settings and leaves
 * `/admin` ITSELF crawlable. Dropping the slash instead over-corrects — a bare
 * `Disallow: /account` would also block a future /accountants, which
 * isPrivatePath deliberately treats as public.
 *
 * So: `$` for the address exactly, and the slash for everything beneath it.
 * That is the same whole-segment rule isPrivatePath applies, said in the syntax
 * robots.txt has for it.
