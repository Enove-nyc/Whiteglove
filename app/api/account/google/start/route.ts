 * because they belong to this browser and this attempt and nothing else needs
 * to see them. The callback compares against the cookie and clears it.
 *
 * What each one stops:
 *   state    — somebody feeding this browser a sign-in it never started.
 *   nonce    — a token from a different attempt being replayed into this one.
 *   verifier — an intercepted code being redeemed by anybody but this browser.
