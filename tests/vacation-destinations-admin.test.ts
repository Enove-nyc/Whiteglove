 * Holiday destinations became editable without a deploy.

 * THE BUG THIS CLOSES: the admin's destination screen read the database's
 * `Destination` table, which holds towns with kevarim in them. Rome, Venice,
 * Florence and seventeen others live in data/vacation-destinations.ts and had
 * no row anywhere, so the owner could not find them in the admin at all and
 * editing one meant editing code and deploying.
